### Apart from the natural reproductive cycle of a sea urchin ###
*shown to influence the reproductive cycles of*

**wild urchins. When food is limited, the size of the gonad** 

- decreases and when food is abundant the - ##gonads are generally larger.##
 Limited feed availability has a negative effect
on the reproductive cycle and when the food supply is
very low (e.g. as can occur in extensive sea urchin barrens) the roe of the urchin may be too small to produce
any reproductive cells (Figure 2). Environmental conditions such as seasonal variation in seawater temperature
can also impact on the reproductive cycle of sea urchins
resulting in enormous variations between populations and
even individuals within a population. A recent study of the
GI of two populations, both situated in kvalsund, close to
Troms√∏ that are only 0.5 km distance apart clearly shows
both seasonal variation and variations between the two
populations, despite their close proximity (Figure 7).
