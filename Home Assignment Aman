# Protocol: *Transformation of DH5a Escherichia coli Bacteria Cells*
# Application:
Transforming of recombinant DNA using DH5a E. coli competent cells. It is widely used in the various cloning and horizontal gene transfer studies. 
### Requirements :
1. Bacterial Cell (Alive)
2. Growing Medium
3. Growing Conditions
4. Plasmid
5. Restriction and Ligation Enzyme etc.
## Procedure:
1. Thaw competent cells on ice (source: Invitrogen MAX Efficiency DH5a, cat# 18258012)
2. Aliquot 20 µl of cells per 1.5 mL tube (negative control, positive control, experiments)
• Refreeze unused cells on dry ice then into -80 °C.
3. Set up control tubes:
a) *Negative control => no DNA*
b) *Positive control => 1 µL of pUC19 DNA (0.01 µg/ml stock)*
4. Add 1 µL of each new ligation (experiment tube) per DH5a cell tube.
5. > Finger flick tube bottom to mix
6. Ice for 30 min.
7. Heat shock 45 seconds at 42 °C in H2O bath.
8. Ice for 2 min.
9. Add 900 µL *Luria-Bertani (LB)* media w/o Ampicillin.
10. Shake at 225 rpm at 37 °C for 1 hour.
11. For plating: 
• **Positive and Negative controls***: use 100 µL of undiluted samples.
• Each experimental tube/ligation, use:
a) 100 µL undiluted (from above
b) 100 µL of 10x dilution (100 µL undiluted + 900 µL LB media)
12. **Spread all conditions of DH5a containing tubes onto LB + Amp (50 µg/mL) plates**.  [https://asm.org/ASM/media/Protocol-Images/Transformation-of-Escherichia-coli-Made-Competent-by-Calcium-Chloride-Protocol.pdf?ext=.pdf]
(negative control, positive control, 2x each experimental tube/ligation)
***Performed near hot flame for sterility***
13. Allow plates to dry on benchtop at room temperature.
14. Invert plates (agar side up) and incubate at 37 °C 
overnight.

The following is the list of bacteria being used as the competent cells across the biological sciences :- 
### Table 1

 Competents Cell | Parent Organisms
| ----------- | ----------- |
 DH5-Aplha | E.Coli |
 Nules-Beta | P. Coci 
 Aureno-60 | S.  Auerous
 Fodo- 100 | L. Bacillus
 BCIX | B. Anthax
 
There are different kinds of competent cells  used on the basis of our biological questions and understandings.
